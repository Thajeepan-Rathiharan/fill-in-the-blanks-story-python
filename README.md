# Story making with Python

## Purpose
This is my first test with Python and it will to create a story with gaps in them, and the user(s) will fill in the gap according to what type of word will be needed to put in the gap. For example if it is an object, <object> would be in place and the user would type in an input like 'box' or 'car'.

## Outcome
After watching the tutorial from the [Youtube_video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21FnnGKSRZo), I was able to recreat the second project shown and understood what went on in the code and what each functions role was.
